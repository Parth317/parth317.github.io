	<h1>The BMW F80 M3!</h1>
	<p>The LCI <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/m/m3.html">F80</a> gets subtle yet tasteful exterior changes.
	</p>
	<p>The community of F80 enthusiasts and other BMW enthusiasts can be found on various <a href="http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=380">forums!</a></p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/m/m3.html">BMW USA</a> website has similar information and pictures of the F80, but it's laid out in a cleaner fashion. The text, links, and background pictures are all blended together so perfectly. I also love the use of drop down menus in the site. 
	</p>


	<p><strong>The Main Exterior Changes for the LCI F80:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>All new headlight design with different angel eyes</li>
		<li>Redesigned led pattern in the tail lights</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	The pre LCI F80 also looks great, especially when in action or event with a BMW Individual color.
